# Blocklife

Blocklife is a base game template for the **Blocklife Luanti Modding community**, built on **Luanti (Minetest)**. It is a simple, peaceful sandbox experience with no built-in enemy mobs or hard goals. While it provides a basic gameplay experience out of the box, it is best played with mods. Blocklife provides the core systems and mechanics needed to start a game while keeping everything modular so players and creators can expand their experience with official and community mods.
