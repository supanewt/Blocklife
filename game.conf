title       = Blocklife
description = Blocklife is a mod built on top of Minetest that is continuously evolving. It is designed as a modular system, with optional add-on mods that allow server owners to enable or disable specific gameplay features. At present, Blocklife functions as a reconstructed clone of Minetest, restructured into a more modular and editor-friendly game experience. It provides extensive documentation and is designed to be easy to navigate and modify. While it offers a basic gameplay experience out of the box, it is intended to be expanded through mods. These additional modules can significantly enhance or completely redefine the game’s mechanics, giving server owners full flexibility in how they design and customize their servers.
